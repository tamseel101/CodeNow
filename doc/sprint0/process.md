## Team Organization and Roles

Our team utilized a democratic approach where all the members had a say in the direction of the project and all the necessary features that need to be included. We organized our workflow in a systematic manner where we held regular meetings to discuss our progress and any issues that arose. To ensure that everyone is on board and meeting the deadlines, we utilized a collaboration tool, Notion, which has been managed by a designated Sprint Manager. The Sprint Manager's role is to organize the workflow and conducts weekly meetings. To maintain a high level of productivity and to ensure equality, the role of the Sprint Manager will rotate within the seven members. For S0, Sana was the Sprint Manager who maintained and organized the work to ensure that the deliverables are well done.

In order to effectively organize our team, task allocation was meticulously divided among all the team members. Each team member was not only responsible for completing their assigned tasks, but also served as a peer reviewer for tasks they did not do. This approach ensured that every deliverable was thoroughly reviewed from an external perspective, ensured clarity, consistency and brevity in the final output.

Our task allocation and teams roles are outlined as follows:

| UI/UX | Proposal | Team Contract | Competition | Setup | Personas | Process | PB | Done | README |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sana | Abdullah | Mohammad | Sana | Abdullah | Melissa | Kyle | Kyle | Mohammad | Abdullah |
| Amelia  | Sana |  |  |  | Amelia  | Melissa | Tamseel |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Abdullah | Sana |  |  |  |

## Decision Making

To ensure fairness in our decision making process, team members were asked to document their concerns which required a decision on our Notion tool. Then, in our regular meetings, each concern is discussed thoroughly and all members have a chance to share their thoughts. To reach consensus, members vote on the best decision. This approach ensures effective and fair decision making with all voices heard and decisions made transparently and democratically. In case of urgent decisions, an emergency meeting is scheduled promptly based on member availability. The same decision making process is used in emergency meetings.

## Prioritizing User Stories

We assigned a 10-point scale to quantify our user story priority and took inspiration from  the Kano Model to prioritize user stories based on their impact on customer satisfaction. Essential stories that met basic customer expectations were given a high priority of 9 or 10. Unexpected and delightful features that greatly enhance customer satisfaction were assigned a moderate priority of 6-8. Non-essential stories that did not significantly impact customer satisfaction were given a low priority rating of 1-5.

To finalize the priority for each user story, we held a meeting to discuss and agree on the appropriate priority. In cases of disagreement, a poll was conducted where each team member ranked the story on a 10-point scale. The final priority for the user story was determined by taking the average of the poll results.

## Meetings

Regular meetings were held twice a week to ensure that all team members were informed and updated on the progress of the project. However, in cases of sudden changes or important decisions, emergency meetings were scheduled to address these matters. Meetings were primarily conducted through Zoom, and in-person discussions were held during class or tutorials for those who were available. The meeting agenda consisted of questions and topics outlined in the meeting document. By the end of each meeting, all questions and concerns were addressed. Attendance was recorded, along with a brief summary of the meeting for those who were unable to attend.

## Next Phase

Moving into the next phase of this project, our group intends to implement a standardized member polling strategy. As a lesson we learned during this phase, we realized that without a proper polling solution, our group has a difficult time making decisions. To overcome this issue, we implemented a strategy of creating a new thread in Discord to gather everyone's opinion on a decision, and the majority vote wins.

Moroever, we strive to avoid last-minute changes and instead aim to establish a solid plan that we can stick to. This will allow us to seek feedback from instructors earlier on and improve upon any areas that need attention. Furthermore, we aim to stick to our plan in order to complete our sprints a day or two in advance, ensuring that we have enough time to review our work and make any necessary adjustments. 

Lastly, it is also important to us that all members are actively participating in the progress of our website and we want to continue being supportive of one another, and providing help and guidance when needed. Additionally, we want to continue utilizing our meeting strategies, such as having a designated meeting coordinator, as well as our organization skills to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.
