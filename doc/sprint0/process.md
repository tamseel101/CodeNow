## Organization Of The Team

Our team has utilized a democratic approach where all the members had a say in the direction of the project and all the necessary features that need to be included. We organized the work-flow in a systematic manner where we held regular meetings to discuss the progress and any issues that arose. To ensure that everyone is on board and meeting the deadlines, we utilized a collaboration tool - Notion - which has been managed by a designated Sprint Manager who organizes the work-flow and conducts weekly meetings. To maintain a high level of productivity and to ensure equality, the role of the meeting coordinator will rotate within the seven members. For S0, Sana was the coordinator who maintained and organized the work to verify that the deliverables are well done.

In order to effectively organize our team, task allocation was meticulously divided among all the team members. Each team member was not only responsible for completing their assigned tasks, but also served as a peer reviewer for tasks they did not do. This approach ensured that every deliverable was thoroughly reviewed from an external perspective, and ensured clarity, consistency and brevity in the final output.  

Our task allocation is outlined as follows: 

| UI/UX | Proposal | Team Contract | Competition | Setup | Personas | Process | PB | Done | README |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sana | Abdullah | Mohammad | Sana | Abdullah | Melissa | Kyle | Kyle | Mohammad | Abdullah |
| Amelia  | Sana |  |  |  | Amelia  | Melissa | Tamseel |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Abdullah | Sana |  |  |  |

## **************************************Decisions and Priority**************************************

In order to ensure effective communication and collaboration, decisions and questions were documented on Notion prior to majority of the meetings. By addressing all the questions during each meeting, we were able to reach a consensus and align our efforts towards a common goal: to deliver a valuable product. In instances where decisions were made outside of these meetings, updates were promptly communicated via our discord server to ensure all members were kept informed. 

The prioritization of tasks was based on a thorough assessment of the complexity of each task. This involved identifying which tasks were more time-consuming and required multiple decisions from the group such as determining a hosting provider, selecting a development stack, and selecting appropriate development tools.

Moreover, we placed a high priority on solidifying our project idea by attending office hours with Jason, and talking to our teaching assistants after tutorials. By seeking feedback and revision of features from Jason and the TAâ€™s, we ensured that our idea was sound and well put together. 

Finally, we also prioritized user experience since that is our key goal. We made sure that the user stories, and key personas are well thought through so that we can deliver a product which ensures user satisfaction. Prioritizing user stories was crucial for the success of the project and it helped us ensure that the development of the website is focussed on the most important features. By identifying and prioritizing key user stories, our team ensured that we are addressing the most pressing needs of the users and that the final product comes out to be functional and user-friendly. Having a good design has allowed us to start making a website that will be easy to use, will adhere to universal design principle, visually appealing, and intuitive. Ultimately, investing in the user stories and UI/UX will increase our chance of making a viable product!  

## Meetings

As previously mentioned, regular meetings were held twice weekly to ensure that all team members were informed and updated on the progress of the project. However, in cases of sudden changes or important decisions, emergency meetings were scheduled to address these matters. Meetings were primarily conducted through Zoom, and in-person discussions were held during class or tutorials for those who were available. The meeting agenda consisted of questions and topics outlined in the meeting document. By the end of each meeting, all questions were addressed and attendance was recorded, along with a brief summary of the meeting for those who were unable to attend.

## Next Phase

Moving into the next phase of this project, our group intends to implement a standardized member polling strategy. As a lesson we learned during this phase, we realized that without a proper polling solution, our group has a difficult time making decisions. To overcome this issue, we implemented a strategy of creating a new thread in Discord to gather everyone's opinion on a decision, and the majority vote wins.

Moroever, we strive to avoid last-minute changes and instead aim to establish a solid plan that we can stick to. This will allow us to seek feedback from instructors earlier on and improve upon any areas that need attention. Furthermore, we aim to stick to our plan in order to complete our sprints a day or two in advance, ensuring that we have enough time to review our work and make any necessary adjustments. 

Lastly, it is also important to us that all members are actively participating in the progress of our website and we want to continue being supportive of one another, and providing help and guidance when needed. Additionally, we want to continue utilizing our meeting strategies, such as having a designated meeting coordinator, as well as our organization skills to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.
