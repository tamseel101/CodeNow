# Problem

Preparing for technical interviews for software engineering positions can be a daunting process. The most common approach is to practice problems on [leetcode.com](http://leetcode.com/). However, it is difficult to determine which problems to do. Many people rely on pre-made lists of Leetcode questions created by others but these lists are not catered towards their specific skillset. Additionally, it quickly becomes difficult to track and manage your progress as you work through the list. Furthermore, a common error in interview preparation is neglecting [distributed practice](https://digitalpromise.org/2019/05/08/ask-the-cognitive-scientist-distributed-practice/) (also known as spaced learning) to address the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://www.mindtools.com/a9wjrjw/ebbinghauss-forgetting-curve).

Our product, CodeNow aims to address these issues through its innovative approach towards technical interview preparation.

# CodeNow Objectives

Note: this persona refers to university students who are proficient at programming and building software but lack the skills to solve problems related to data structures and algorithms.<br>

<br>

****************Scenario****************

Suzie recognizes that she is not the greatest at solving data structures and algorithm-related problems. She makes an effort to improve by signing up for [Leetcode.com](http://Leetcode.com) but is quickly overwhelmed with the sheer amount of practice problems on the website. Additionally, the website contains a variety of problems, including problems requiring the knowledge of arrays, graphs, linked lists and many more. Suzie wishes she knew which problems to focus on based on her current strength and weaknesses. Fortunately for Suzie, she discovered our product, CodeNow. Codenow assessed her current understanding of data structures and algorithms through a pre-assessment quiz and then created a tailored list of leetcode questions for her to solve. Suzie was also able to set learning goals such as the number of problems to do each day. CodeNow made the interview preperation process seamless and fun for Suzie!

## Key Persona 2: Ariel Winter

Ariel is a software engineer with years of experience who was recently laid off. Ariel is hunting for a new job as a Software Engineer, but her technical interview skills have deteriorated over time. She has recently begun preparing for technical interviews and has difficulty remembering certain key concepts.

Note: this persona refers to people of any experience level who struggle with the effects of Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve.

<br>

******************************************Scenario******************************************

Ariel landed an interview at Uber and was presented with a question she had previously solved on Leetcode during her interview preparation. However, to his surprise, he could not recall the right approach to the problem due to the affects of Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. As a result, she could not move to the next stage of the hiring process. Luckily, Ariel discovered CodeNow, a product which recognizes the importance of distributed practice and the effects of the Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve. CodeNow is built around the idea of distributed practice and strategically places previously solved problems into the users’ Leetcode schedule. Because of CodeNow’s unique approach to interview preparation, Ariel is able to mitigate the effects of the Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve.

## Key Persona 3: Eren Yeager

Eren is an aspiring software engineer who recently graduated from the University of Waterloo. Eren has ADHD and finds it difficult to focus and stay organized. This makes it really difficult for him to prepare for technical interviews. Eren performs best when given structure, reminders, and a quantifiable way to measure his progress.

Note: this persona refers to people who want a structured approach to preparing for interviews and would love features that make interview preparation more accessible.

<br>

****************Scenario****************

Eren applied to many software engineering related positions and was able to get an interview at Microsoft. Conquered by happiness, Eren makes an effort to sign up for Leetcode and finds a list of commonly asked interview questions online. He started practicing them but found it difficult to organize his progress. Some days, he did not remember to practice them at all. Eventually, it was the day before the interview, and Eren panicked because his interview preparation journey had been a disaster. Out of fear, he cancelled his interview. Fortunately for Eren, he soon discovered our product, CodeNow. CodeNow provided him with a structured approach to practice Leetcode questions. CodeNow presented Eren with a tailored plan according to his strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the platform asked Eren to provide key metrics such as time taken to complete the problem, perceived difficulty, and to rate his attempt out of 5. CodeNow used this information to schedule other Leetcode questions for Eren and actively updated his plan. Additionally, the platform let him visually see his progress as he completes his questions through a graph. Eren fell in love with CodeNow and regularly practiced Leetcode because of CodeNow’s daily notifications reminding him to practice!

# Market Research and Business Potential

According to the data from [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6), the employment of software developers is projected to grow rapidly. There is a 25% increase expected from 2021 to 2031. Additionally, the current demand for software engineers is high. In the United States, there is an average of 162 900 job openings projected each year over the next decade. Additionally, according to the data from [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://www.collegetransitions.com/blog/most-popular-college-majors/), the number of computer science degrees awarded in 2020 has increased significantly, with a 40-fold increase from the 1970s. To summarize, the software engineering field offers numerous opportunities for job seekers.

To land a software engineering job, many candidates dedicate significant effort to preparing for technical interviews. These interviews typically involve Leetcode-style questions, which test the candidate's problem-solving and programming skills. These questions are widely utilized in software engineering interview evaluations.

Furthermore, the popularity of technical interview preperation websites like [AlgoExpert.io](http://AlgoExpert.io) and [Neetcode.io](http://Neetcode.io) suggest that there is an increasing business potential within the space of technical interview preperation services.

Our platform offers unique features such as incorporating distributed practice, tracking key metrics, and suggesting Leetcode questions based on the user’s strengths and weaknesses.

# Feasability

This section is aims to convince the reader that this product is feasible within the semester timeframe. There are few components of the product that must be addressed.

1. we are not making the user complete the problems on our platform. Instead, we direct them to specific problems on Leetcode.com. where they can utilize Leetcode’s code editor and numerous high quality test cases written per problem.
2. we are not building a distributed practice algorithm from scratch. We will be using the SuperMemo2 algorithm to compute the next review date for each problem. Note that there is a `supermemo2` package available on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/supermemo2/).
3. In our minimum viable product, the tailored plan will be generated based on the user's answers to a pre-assessment quiz (consisting of multiple-choice questions). For instance, if the user consistently struggles with array-based questions, we will prioritize Leetcode problems related to arrays. No machine learning or complex algorithms are involved.
