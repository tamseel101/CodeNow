Leetcode, Neetcode, and AlgoExpert are platforms that offers a large collection of coding problems and challenges, and are organized by difficulty levels and/or topics. In the following paragraph, we will explore why CodeNow surpasses it’s competitors.

### **How our product differs**

CodeNow is a user-friendly platform that offers a personalized learning experience that caters to the individual needs and areas of improvement of the user. Even though CodeNow and it's competitors share similar features such as allowing the users to practice leetcode styled questions, our platform solves extra key fundamental issues. Instead of picking and spending time choosing which question to do, CodeNow allows the user to focus on specific questions from different concepts and creates a diagram to showcase their weaknesses and strengths. 

Moreover, our platform also provides the user with a comprehensive road map, suggesting them questions that would help clear their misunderstandings with the concepts they are struggling with. CodeNow focuses on distributed practice by notifying the users to redo questions they have attempted before to solidify the users understanding and mastery of the material. Whether our user is a beginner or a seasoned veteran, CodeNow is the ultimate tool for mastering the art of coding interviews.

### **Key scenarios where our product exceeds it’s competitors**

**Scenario 1:** Alex is a second-year student at the University of Toronto pursuing Computer Science. He wants to solve Leetcode-styled questions because he aims to gain an internship this winter; however, he does not know where to start. Alex goes on CodeNow and does the pre assessment quiz, which allows him to focus on a smaller range of questions and get an opportunity to identify his weaknesses and strengths.

Note how easy it became for Alex to start his interview preparation journey through CodeNow. Instead of being bombarded with a plethora of questions, he now has a set amount of questions to do, which will eventually showcase his strengths and weaknesses. There was no need for him to search through multiple questions and being overwhelmed, he can now excel in preparing for software development interviews.   

******************Scenario 2:****************** Sia recently got laid off from [forma.ai](http://forma.ai) as a new software developer employee, due to poor economic circumstances and cross-cuttings. She is upset but determined to find another job in the same field. Sia has been practicing leet code-styled questions but always seems to forget key steps during interviews, even if she has previously solved those questions or briefly knows the overall idea. Sia is upset and acknowledges that she is a victim of Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve phenomenon. She goes to CodeNow and finds out that the platform allows users to repeat questions they have done in the past to maximize learning retention for their users. 

Note how CodeNow has solved a very common problem that people face during their interviews: the forgetting curve phenomenon. Sia can now practice questions multiple times by getting notified by CodeNow; she does not have to worry about forgetting the key steps during her interviews because she will now get an opportunity to understand the concepts fully! 

### **********Why our competitors did not solve these problems**********

Platforms such as Leetcode or Neetcode do not have a specific target audience. Instead, they focus on a vast majority of users who would like to get practice with questions that could potentially show up in technical interviews. All these platforms have started to gain popularity in recent years, and it would be a hassle for them to revamp their original idea of catering users with an abundance of questions for further practice. 

These platforms provide users with a large collection of coding problems, and allows them to work independently without any guidance or suggestions. Revamping their platforms to accommodate and add extra features will be complex and a resource-intensive process. Since their target audience is a vast majority of people, they would not want to spend a significant amount in planning, development and testing their platforms again.
