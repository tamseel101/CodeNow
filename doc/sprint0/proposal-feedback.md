Having 'students' as the target users seems a bit general. What kind of 
students? from where? With what level of education? Being more specific 
about target users may reveal more about specific needs and can help 
cater your app to your users. 

Another problem is ease of use. Most students have access to phones and 
computers which already have built-in, highly engineered and optimized 
to-do lists and calendars where students for example color code their 
work and simply take a look at the calendar app to see where workload 
intensity is highest. For most students, going to some other app for 
this purpose would seem like too much work. As students yourself, ask 
yourself honestly if you would use the app or just use a built-in 
calendar that you probably already use to keep track of your workload. 
Provide users solid reasons or features that will motivate them to take 
the time out to use your app rather than just use a built-in solution
and hyper focus on selling those key reasons/features. Note that your 
selling points donâ€™t only have to be new innovative features, you can 
focus on things like useability, design, aesthetics, etc. 

Also try to be specific with which platform you're using, 
web/mobile/etc and think about what are the pros and cons of the
platform versus other platforms and talk about how your chosen 
platform can elevate the user experience.
