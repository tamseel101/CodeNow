## What are practices that we should continue this sprint?

---

As we move forward in this sprint, it is important that we continue to maintain and build upon practices that have been successful for us as a software development team. These practices include our use of CI/CD and Github workflow/checks to streamline the development process and ensure consistency and quality in our code. Additionally, good communication practices that were effective in the last sprint, such as regular team meetings and clear communication channels, should continue. It is also important that we maintain good work ethics, including punctuality, accountability, and a willingness to collaborate and support each other. By continuing to implement and build upon these practices, we can ensure a successful and efficient sprint.

## What are some new collaborative practices that we might want to use during next sprint?

---

Collaboration is key when working on the same codebase, and there are several practices that can enhance teamwork and productivity during the next sprint. One important practice is to provide feedback on each other's code to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that any potential issues are addressed early on. Additionally, it's important to allocate time for bug fixes and code reviews to avoid any technical debt and ensure that the codebase is always in a healthy state. By implementing these practices, we can work more efficiently and effectively as a team and achieve better outcomes during the next sprint.

## What are (if any) harmful collaborative practices we should stop using during next sprint?

---

In any software development project, it is important to identify any harmful practices that could hinder the progress of the team. Some harmful collaborative practices that we should avoid in the next sprint are:

1. Neglecting code feedback: It's important to give timely and constructive feedback on code changes made by teammates. Neglecting to provide feedback can result in overlooked issues and bugs, which can have a negative impact on the overall quality of the project.
2. Ignoring bugs: Bugs are inevitable in any software development project, and it's important to address them in a timely manner. Ignoring bugs can lead to more serious issues down the line, making it harder to fix the problem later on.

By avoiding these harmful collaborative practices, we can ensure that our team is working efficiently and effectively towards a successful project completion.

## What was your best/worst experience as a group during sprint 3?

---

During the third sprint of our development process, our team experienced no significant negative occurrences. However, there was a sense of unease among team members on the last day of the sprint as there was a concern that things might not work out as planned. Nonetheless, this anxiety proved to be unfounded, and the team was able to deliver high-quality work on time. One of the best experiences the team had during the sprint was the significant progress made in comparison to the previous sprint. The team was able to complete a lot more work, which was evident in the quality of work done.
