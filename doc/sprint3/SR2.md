## What are practices that we should continue this sprint?

---

To ensure a successful sprint, it is crucial to maintain and build upon certain practices that have proven effective. First, we should continue to utilize CI/CD and our Github workflow/checks to streamline the development process. Second, it's important to aim for dev to be pulled to main at least 6 hours prior to the demo to reduce stress and avoid last-minute issues. Third, we should continue working collaboratively to connect pieces of the software, especially between frontend and backend. Additionally, we should maintain consistent work when pushing or committing changes on GitHub and approving PR requests, as this has become a good habit. Consistency in creating branches on GitHub and approving PR requests has also been beneficial, and should continue. Lastly, getting all code merged ahead of time and doing multiple test runs of the demo further reduces stress and ensures no issues arise. By continuing these practices, we can ensure a smoother and more successful sprint.

## What are some new collaborative practices that we might want to use during next sprint?

---

To improve collaboration during the next sprint, there are a few new practices to consider. First, ensuring that everyone is involved in the process and feels a sense of ownership is crucial. This can be achieved by having more meetings and communication, such as having a minimum of two stand-ups per week through meetings. Second, having more discussions and updates on tasks from everyone can help keep everyone in the loop about the general state of things. Third, having more meetings with everyone and active chats can help improve communication. Fourth, open and crystal clear communication is essential for the success of the project. To achieve this, questions should be asked to the whole group during meetings to ensure that everyone understands the user stories properly. Fifth, it's important for people to be online more often and for everyone to be aware of what everyone else is doing to improve communication. Lastly, encouraging individuals to speak up about their concerns and having the courage to address them can help address issues and improve the group dynamic.

## What are (if any) harmful collaborative practices we should stop using during next sprint?

---

To ensure a successful and efficient next sprint, it's important to identify any harmful collaborative practices that should be stopped. One such practice is the previous managerial structure that didn't allow for equal ownership and contribution from all team members. Additionally, lack of updates, communication with some members and not all, and assigning tasks without their input can lead to confusion and redundant work. It's important to ensure open and crystal-clear communication among the group members, with everyone involved and aware of updates and the general state of things. Finally, assigning tasks based on individual preferences can also help improve the quality of work and reduce stress.

## What was your best/worst experience as a group during sprint 2?

---

It is evident from the responses that the best and worst experiences during sprint 2 varied among group members. Some team members felt positive about the lack of stress during the sprint and the growth of the product, while others felt best when they were able to construct direct and specific tasks that people could follow and complete. However, the worst experiences were consistently related to communication issues, lack of updates, and not knowing where other people were in the process. It is important to note that some team members felt left out of the majority of things and were unable to give their best performance, while others felt that tasks were being prioritized based on completing everything instead of focusing on tasks that were worth the most marks.
