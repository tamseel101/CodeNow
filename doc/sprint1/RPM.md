### Release Goal

We want to build all of our core features, minimize bugs, and ensure that the user interface is both visually appealing and intuitive to use. 

The following are our planned core features: 

- A functional web application that allows for users to create their account for Code Next. (user-story/accounts: [https://trello.com/c/Zkbs33vv](https://trello.com/c/Zkbs33vv))
- Continuously update our platforms understanding of the user’s strengths and weaknesses according to the feedback they provide us after attempting a Leetcode problem and tracking performance. (user-story/track-key-metrics: [https://trello.com/c/9hQnZVbC](https://trello.com/c/9hQnZVbC))
- Enable the user to view all assigned Leetcode problem on a Dashboard. Additionally, by pressing a button on a specific problem, the user is sent to Leetcode to complete the problem. (user-story/dashboard: [https://trello.com/c/6dXzmj73](https://trello.com/c/6dXzmj73))

The following are our planned major tasks

- A landing page for the user. This is a subtask related to creating a functional web application (task/landing-page: [https://trello.com/c/V2k7Pa26](https://trello.com/c/V2k7Pa26))
- Be able to start a leetcode question by pressing a button. This subtask is related to the dashboard, which contains cards of each Leetcode problem (task/start-leet-question: [https://trello.com/c/zmmMF7Dh](https://trello.com/c/zmmMF7Dh))
