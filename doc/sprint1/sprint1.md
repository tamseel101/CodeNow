# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

### Meeting

Sprint 1 planning was done over 2 meetings. The first meeting occurred on January 31st, 2023. The second occurred the following day, February 1st, 2023. 

### Sprint Goal

Satisfy the following user stories:

- As Suzie, Eren, or Ariel, I want to have an account so that I can save my current progress to continue practicing in the future.
- As Ariel, Suzie, or Eren, I want to see a list of suggested Leetcode questions.
- As Ariel, Suzie, or Eren, I want to be able to click on a Leetcode question on my dashboard and be taken to the question
- As Ariel, Suzie, or Eren, I want the ability to cancel a problem attempt without completing it in case I am unable to complete it due to an unforeseen situation
- As Eren or Suzie, I want to be able to track my progress on Leetcode problems using metrics like completion time, difficulty level, and score.
- As Eren, Suzie or Ariel, I want to learn more about the product through a visually appealing landing page

### Spikes

During this sprint we encountered 3 major spikes

- Learning React and other new technologies. This was a major blocker, since we had to spend time experiencing a learning curve before any meaningful progress was made on the assigned task
- We had trouble deciding how to split the user stories and underestimated the amount of work associated with some stories. Additionally, we did not have a clear idea on how to set up or organize the Trello board
- Sometimes coordination between all members was difficult, as everyone has different schedules and there could be delays if we are waiting for an answer or approval of a pull request.
