# Sprint Retrospective Meeting

We had our Sprint Retrospective Meeting on February 13th 2023 on the official Discord server. During this meeting, we discussed the core functionality of our project, release goals, and the scope. 

### Participants who Attended

All team members were present and contributed equally during the meeting:

Amelia, Kyle, Melissa, Mohammad-Ali, Tamseel, Sana, Abdullah

### Unfinished Tasks from S1

Of the planned tasks in s1, all were completed. Thus, no user stories from s1 will be added to the s2 backlog.

### Practices

As a team, we discussed practices that were good, what we should add, and what should be avoided for the next sprint.

**Practices to continue**

- Accomplishing tasks as a team, since in the last sprint everyone contributed
- Having regular meetings to keep people up to date
- The pull request, and reviewing pull request comment format is easy to read and clear

**Practices to add** 

- Doing standups and meetings on Discord instead of zoom. Discord is more accessible, as no meeting room has to be made
- Having a practice run through of the demo to the TA at the end of the sprint

**Practices to discontinue**

- Having multiple reviewers for pull requests. In most cases, both reviewers would agree on the same things, and waiting for a second reviewer would cause a blocker to merging the branch. Additionally, with less members, it will be more difficult to have 2 people ready to review a branch quickly.

### Best and Worst Experiences

As a team, we agreed that the best experience was seeing the site running after all of us worked on something individually. Seeing everything come together shows how a lot can be done if everyone does a small part.

Additionally, we agreed that the worse experience was the last minute merging and going into the project demo with the TA with minimal practice.
